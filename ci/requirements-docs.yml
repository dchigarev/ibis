# TODO: The conda solver takes forever when pymapd is installed, with the rest of
# Ibis dependencies. It has been excluded from the tests for now, so we add it here.
# Once the solver problem is fixed, this should be in ci/requirements-3.*-dev.yml
# (the one used for the docs), and removed from here.
